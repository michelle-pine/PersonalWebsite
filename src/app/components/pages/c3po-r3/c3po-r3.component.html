    <p>In 2018, <a href="https://c3po-r3.chboston.org/#/about/background/c3po">The Congenital Cardiac Catheterization Project on Outcomes (C3PO) </a>sought to update their website to their third iteration: C3PO-R3. As a UI designer and front-end developer at Boston Children's Hospital, I was enlisted to aid them in this endeavor. In doing so, I was able to both design and develop the front end of their website entirely from scratch. The external site is still live and available to users and hospital employees all over the world, but you can view a demo of my original design as well!</p>
   
    <p>This project was mocked-up in Balsamiq, prototyped in HTML, and developed in Angular 4 + typescript. </p>
    <p>Below is a demo separated from Boston Children's databases to preserve patient priacy. The login credentials for the demo are 'username' and 'password'. </p>

    <p>On the live site below, the internal site is not accessible to the public. Sorry!</p>
