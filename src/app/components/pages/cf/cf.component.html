    <p>In 2018, while I was on co-op at Boston Children's Hospital, I helped develop the front-end of a fitness
      application intended to help children with heart problems improve their fitness! </p>
    <p>This project was mocked-up in Balsamiq, prototyped with Invision and HTML, and developed in Angular.</p>
